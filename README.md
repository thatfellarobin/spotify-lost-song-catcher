# spotify-lost-song-catcher
If a song disappeared from spotify since the last time you ran the script, it will let you know.

You need to install spotipy to use this script: https://github.com/plamere/spotipy

Instructions:
1. go to the Spotify for developers website (https://developer.spotify.com/) and create a new app.
2. In the app settings, add a redirect URI: http://localhost/
3. Get the client id and client secret from your app and copy them into the respective places in the script.
4. Add your username to the script (should be a series of numbers, you can find it by copying your profile uri from the spotify app)
5. Run it!
